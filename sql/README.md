# Instacart Dataset — SQL Analysis

This folder contains exploratory SQL queries and supporting notebooks using the [Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/instacart-online-grocery-basket-analysis-dataset/data) to demonstrate analytical thinking, database skills, and portfolio development.

## The Project

This project is part of my career pivot into and exploration of data analytics and consulting. I’ve designed this as a hands-on portfolio to show how I use my alternative dev, product, marketing, and operations experience to explore structured data, ask business-relevant questions, and surface insights through SQL and Python (using DuckDB + Pandas). 

The dataset simulates real-world grocery shopping behavior and consists of over 3 million grocery orders.

## Folder Contents

- `load_data.ipynb` — Sets up DuckDB and loads the original CSVs as tables.
- `exploration_*.ipynb` — Query notebooks that explore user behavior, product trends, and operational metrics.
- `.sql` files — Saved SQL queries for reproducibility and structure.

## Dataset Download

Due to GitHub’s file size limits, the raw dataset is not included here. You can download the full original dataset from this Kaggle Link:

-> [Download the dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/instacart-online-grocery-basket-analysis-dataset/data)

Once downloaded, unzip it and place the CSVs in a `/sql/instacart/` folder. Then open and run `load_data.ipynb` to get started.

## Sample Questions Explored

- What are the most frequently reordered products?
- Which aisles are most popular by user type?
- How does order behavior change by day of week and hour of day?
- Which users are most loyal or high-value?

## Tools & Tech

- [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)
- Python 3 / Pandas
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git/GitHub

## Notes

This is a public-facing portfolio project. It's designed more for storytelling and exploration than production data engineering. The goal is to clearly demonstrate problem-solving and data literacy using real-world-sized datasets.
