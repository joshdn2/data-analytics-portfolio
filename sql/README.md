# Instacart Dataset - SQL Analysis

This folder contains exploratory SQL queries and EDA using the [Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/instacart-online-grocery-basket-analysis-dataset/data) to demonstrate analytical thinking, database skills, and ability to generate insight from data.

## The Project

This project is part of my career pivot into and exploration of data analytics and consulting. Iâ€™ve designed this as a hands-on portfolio to show how I use my dev, product, marketing, and operations experience to explore structured data, ask business-relevant questions, and surface insights through SQL (with Python + DuckDB as the vehicle). 

The dataset simulates real-world grocery shopping behavior and consists of millions of grocery orders.
