# Excel Data Analysis and Actionable Insights

This folder contains exploratory data analysis using excel and a [dataset from Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?accessType=open&dataStructure=Multiple%20tables&order=date_added%2Cdesc&page=2&pageSize=5) to demonstrate proficiency with Excel PivotTables, Lookup functions, and general use, as well as skill with Exploratory Data Analysis. 

## The Project

This project is part of my career pivot into and exploration of data analytics and consulting. Iâ€™ve designed this as a hands-on portfolio to show how I use my dev, product, marketing, and operations experience to explore structured data, ask business-relevant questions, and surface insights using Excel. 

The dataset simulates real-world online candy orders.
