##  Why the Pivot?

After several years improving products & internal processes, I found I enjoyed **digging through data to uncover efficiency wins** and framing those insights for stakeholders. 
I worked as a software engineer and product manager on private company software solutions, so I decided my re-education in the analytics space needed to be demonstrable, hence this repo. 
I have worked part-time on a marketing agency of my own and have decided it's time to return to the corporate scene while keeping the marketing up on the side. 
I’m now doubling-down on this skillset by shipping real, inspectable assets every week. Proof > certificates.
