# 🛠 Data-Analytics Portfolio & Sprint Tracker

Hi, I’m **Josh** - a former product/dev professional now working to pivot into **analytics & consulting** roles.  
This repo is my public build-log: every folder contains a deliverable that demonstrates a specific skill (SQL, Python/Pandas, BI dashboards, consulting storytelling).

##  Why the Pivot?

After several years improving products & internal processes, I found I enjoyed **digging through data to uncover efficiency wins** and framing those insights for stakeholders. 
I worked as a software engineer and product manager on private company software solutions, so I decided my re-education in the analytics space needed to be demonstrable, hence this repo. 
I have worked parttime on a marketing agency of my own and have decided it's time to return to the corporate scene. 
I’m now doubling-down on that skillset—proof > certificates, by shipping real, inspectable assets every week.
